<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<p>This month, your goal will be to find the shortest way to connect a set of points, otherwise known as the Steiner Tree Problem.  Not only can you draw lines between points, but you can also generate new points to further minimize your solution.  All of the given points must be connected in your solution, and the Steiner Tree with the smallest total distance wins.</p>

<h3>Problem Specifics</h3>
<p>Upon opening the starter package, you will find <code>st.txt</code>, a file containing one thousand lines of two space-separated decimal numbers. Each line represents one given point, with an x and y value seperated by a space. The input file looks like this:</p>

<pre>
x_1 y_1
x_2 y_2
x_3 y_3
...
x_999 y_999
x_1000 y1_000
</pre>

<p>The output should consist of a file containing some number of lines (although fewer than 999 would necessarily give an invalid solution) connecting two points. Each line should contain four space-separated decimal numbers, corresponding to the x and y locations of the first point of the line and the x and y locations of the second point of the line.</p>

<pre>
x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2
x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2
x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2
...
x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2
</pre>

It is highly recommended that you use double-precision floating point numbers for your calculations and output or we cannot guarantee that your solution will be valid, as points on the lines must precisely match the points from <code>st.txt</code> to be counted as matching.</p>

<p>The starter code, provided for C++, Java, and Python, will read in and parse the file for you, as well as output a given set of edges to solution file out.txt for submission. The filename of your submission will not affect your solution in any way. The starter packages can be found <a href="problems/starterpackages/ST.zip" download>here</a>, and the input file can be found <a href="problems/input/st.txt" download>here</a>. Good luck!</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>You can use anything on Wikipedia for reference. Use of the Internet for algorithmic purposes is acceptable, but you may not copy and paste code.  Online documentation and existing StackOverflow answers can be used as a guide. Academic papers can also be referenced for algorithmic purposes, but copying code is not allowed.  Collaboration between students is encouraged, but your solutions should be your own.</p>
